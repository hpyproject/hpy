Version 0.9 (April 25th, 2023)
------------------------------

This release adds numerous major features and indicates the end of HPy's *alpha*
phase. We've migrated several key packages to HPy (for a list, see our website
https://hpyproject.org) and we are now confident that HPy is mature enough for
being used as serious extension API. We also plan that the next major release
will be ``1.0``.

Major new features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support subclasses of built-in types
  It is now possible to create pure HPy types that inherit from built-in types
  like ``type`` or ``float``. This was already possible before but in a very
  limited way, i.e., by setting :c:member:`HPyType_Spec.basicsize` to ``0``. In
  this case, the type implicitly inherited the basic size of the supertype but
  that also means that you cannot have a custom C struct. It is now possible
  inherit from a built-in type **AND** have a custom C struct. For further
  reference, see :c:member:`HPyType_Spec.builtin_shape` and
  :c:enum:`HPyType_BuiltinShape`.

Support for metaclasses
  HPy now supports creating types with metaclasses. This can be done by passing
  type specification parameter with kind
  :c:enumerator:`HPyType_SpecParam_Metaclass` when calling
  :c:func:`HPyType_FromSpec`.

:term:`HPy Hybrid ABI`
  In addition to :term:`CPython ABI` and :term:`HPy Universal ABI`, we now
  introduced the Hybrid ABI. The major difference is that whenever you use a
  legacy API like :c:func:`HPy_AsPyObject` or :c:func:`HPy_FromPyObject`, the
  prdouced binary will then be specific to one interpreter. This was necessary
  to ensure that universal binaries are really portable and can be used on any
  HPy-capable interpreter.

:doc:`trace-mode`
  Similar to the :doc:`debug-mode`, HPy now provides the Trace Mode that can be
  enabled at runtime and helps analyzing API usage and identifying performance
  issues.

:ref:`porting-guide:multi-phase module initialization`
  HPy now support multi-phase module initialization which is an important
  feature in particular needed for two important use cases: (1) module state
  support (which is planned to be introduced in the next major release), and (2)
  subinterpreters. We decided to drop support for single-phase module
  initialization since this makes the API cleaner and easier to use.

HPy :ref:`porting-guide:calling protocol`
  This was a big missing piece and is now eventually available. It enables slot
  ``HPy_tp_call``, which can now be used in the HPy type specification. We
  decided to use a calling convention similar to CPython's vectorcall calling
  convention. This is: the arguments are passed in a C array and the keyword
  argument names are provided as a Python tuple. Before this release, the only
  way to create a callable type was to set the special method ``__call__``.
  However, this has several disadvantages. In particular, poor performance on
  CPython (and maybe other implementations) and it was not possible to have
  specialized call function implementations per object (see
  :c:func:`HPy_SetCallFunction`)

Added APIs

Deleting attributes and items
  :c:func:`HPy_DelAttr`, :c:func:`HPy_DelAttr_s`, :c:func:`HPy_DelItem`, :c:func:`HPy_DelItem_i`, :c:func:`HPy_DelItem_s`

Incompatible changes to version 0.0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changed macro :c:macro:`HPy_MODINIT` because of multi-phase module init
  support.
* Replace environment variable ``HPY_DEBUG`` by ``HPY`` (see :doc:`debug-mode`
  or :doc:`trace-mode`).
